Cartesian closed categories are not regarded as complete models of the Simply Typed $$\lambda$$-calculus in the traditional sense. Let's see why. 

Assume $$\Lambda_X$$ is the set of closed well-typed STLC (Simply Typed $$\lambda$$-calculus) terms.
Clearly, STLC can be interpreted into any Cartesian Closed category (CCC) by defining an interpretation function 
$$[\![\cdot]\!] : \Lambda_X \to \mathcal{C}$$ such that for any term $$t \in \Lambda_X$$ , $$[\![t]\!] \in \mathcal{C}(1, [\![\sigma]\!])$$ where $$\sigma$$ is the type of $$t$$. We will only consider well-typed interpretations here. Moreover, it can be proved that the interpretation function is sound and complete.  The completeness statement reads as follows. For all terms $$t_1$$ and $$t_2$$,

$$t_1 \equiv_{\beta\eta} t_2 \text{ iff } [\![t_1]\!] = [\![t_2]\!] $$

where the $$(\Rightarrow)$$ direction is soundness whereas $$(\Leftarrow)$$ is *completeness of the interpretation*.

This statement is certainly true. If two terms are $$\beta\eta$$ equivalent they are equal in the model, i.e. the semantics is agnostic to $$\beta\eta$$-step reductions. Conversely, all equations that hold for any two STLC-denotable terms also hold in the syntax. 

However, completeness of a model is a slightly different statement:

$$t_1 =_{\beta\eta} t_2 \text{ iff for all } [\![ \cdot ]\!] : \Lambda_X \to \mathcal{C}, [\![t_1]\!] = [\![t_2]\!] $$

This one states that fixed a category $$\mathcal{C}$$, $$\beta\eta$$-equivalence between terms holds if and only if these two terms are equal in **every** possible interpretation. 

In this sense, CCC categories are not *complete models*. The counter example is given by the preorder category $$\mathcal{P}$$ with CCC structure. The preorder the category has at most one morphism ($$\sqsubset$$) between objects. If this category has the greatest element $$\top$$, binary meets ($$\wedge$$) and Heyting implications ($$\to$$) then $$\mathcal{P}$$ is CCC. 

Now the problem is that when the category is thin every (well-typed) interpretation interprets two programs of the same type into morphisms of the same type, but since the category is thin these two morphisms are always equal. 
For example, consider the projection maps out of the product  $$x \wedge x \xrightarrow{\pi_1} x$$ and $$x \wedge x \xrightarrow{\pi_2} x$$ for the particular case when the codomain of the two coincide. In $$\mathcal{P}$$ these two are the same map, i.e. $$\pi_1 = \pi_2$$. 

Now the right-hand side of the completeness theorem is satisfied since For all well-typed interpretations $$[\![\cdot]\!]$$ we have $$[\![\pi_1]\!] = [\![\pi_2]\!]$$ (when the codomain of the two is the same). However, the projections $$\pi_1$$ and $$\pi_2$$ in the syntax are definitely not $$\beta\eta$$-equivalent. 


I will defer the reader to the [original paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0014068) for more details.
