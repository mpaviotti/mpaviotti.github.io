My research is based on idea of "*Computational Trinity*" which is a profound insight dating back to the '70s that `Computer Science`, `Intuitionistic Logic` and `Category Theory`  are essentially "three sides" of the same coin.

Consider a terminating functional program $$f$$ that takes an input of type $$A$$ and produces an output of type $$B$$

$$f : A \to B$$ 

This program can be also viewed as a **proof** that $$A$$ implies $$B$$ and as a morphism between the objects $$A$$ and $$B$$. Thus total functional programming, intuitionistic logic and category theory 
are three different mathematical subjects that describe the same idea. 

While these are interesting subjects on their own, they also have **practical applications** in `structuring functional programs`, `formal verification` and in the `design` of the next generation of programming languages.

As of today, `Haskell` is probably one of the most successful examples of how Category Theory influenced the design of a programming language and how it is continuing to inspire new programming techniques, e.g `Recursion Schemes`, to structure programs even further thus ensuring these have well-understood safety properties.

# Denotational Semantics
The intuition that *programs* should be regarded as *functions* and *types* should be regarded as "*mathematical objects*" is due to Christopher Strachey and Dana Scott. 

This is formalised via a *denotational interpretation* which is a *compositional* interpretation function of the syntax of a programming language $$\mu \Sigma$$ into a mathematical object called a *semantic domain* $$\mathcal{D}$$ 

$$[\![\cdot ]\!] : \mu \Sigma \to \mathcal{D}$$

This function is furthermore characterised by two additional properties. The first is called `Soundness` and it states that the interpretation has to be agnostic to step reductions. The second is called `Computational Adequacy`  which states that if two programs are equated then they are observationally indistinguishable. Furthermore, a semantics that equates exactly the programs that are observationally indistinguishable is called `Fully Abstract`. 

The theory was developed by Christopher Strachey and Dana Scott between 1969 and 1971. The best introduction to these topics is probably [Thomas Streicher's book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Theoretic-Foundations-Functional-Programming-Streicher/dp/9812701427).


# Recursion Schemes 
A recursion scheme is a structuring device that ensures that recursive definitions are well-defined. 

For an inductive data type, e.g. the lists over a type `a`, the `foldr` function takes a base case of type `b` 
and the inductive step of the recursion and returns a function from `[a] -> b`. 

{% highlight haskell %}
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr ind base []     = base
foldr ind base (x:xs) = ind x (foldr ind base xs) 
{% endhighlight %}

In Haskell, assuming the user only feeds well-defined functions to the `foldr` then `foldr` itself is well-defined.

Category theory generalises this concept to any inductive data type.
In particular, a `fold` function is in the *unique extension* of an algebra for a functor $$F$$ .

Haskell is particularly good at dealing with these abstract definitions. In fact, we can use type classes and recursive types to implement a `fold` for any functor $$F$$ (that has a least fixed-point)

{% highlight haskell %}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}

import Data.Functor

data Fix f = In {inOp :: f (Fix f)}

fold :: (Functor f) => (f b -> b) -> Fix f -> b
fold alg = alg . fmap (fold alg) . inOp
{% endhighlight %}

However, not every well-defined function can be defined in terms 
of `fold`s (or `unfolds`) directly, but it has been shown that every recursion 
scheme that has been observed is an instance of an [adjoint (un)fold](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/65842535/Nicolas_Wu_Unifying_Structured_Recursion_Schemes.pdf). 

# Guarded recursion 
Guarded recursion is a form or recursion where the recursive call is guarded by a 
modality $$\blacktriangleright$$ called the "*later*" operator. 

This is useful for checking productivity of definitions and solve recursive domain 
equations that are in general hard (or impossible) to prove well-defined. 

The later modality is essentially an abstract device to talk about step-indexed definitions. The idea of step-indexing is to break the circularity of definitions by using a natural number that allows us to get a handle of recursion. 

The easiest example of the use of guarded recursion is the guarded streams defined as the *unique* solution to the following equation

$$ \text{Str}^{g} A = A \times \blacktriangleright \text{Str}^{g} A$$

The intuitive meaning of this type is that while the head of the stream is available now, 
the tail of the stream is available only after one step of computation. 

### nCatLab

I contribute to [nCatLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) by maintaining
the following pages 

- [Synthetic Guarded Domain Theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic+guarded+domain+theory)
- [Guarded Recursion](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/guarded+recursion)
- [Recursion Schemes](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/recursion+scheme)

The end result is that productivity for elements of $$\text{Str}^{g}$$ is guaranteed by the type system. 

## ISO Standards 
Modular Relaxed Dependencies (MRD) is a prospective model of C++ concurrency
(first appeared in [ESOP'20'](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-44914-8_22.pdf))
which is being considered for the next ISO standard of C++.
